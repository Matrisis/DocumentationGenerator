# Core Workflows and Data Flows
The DocumentationGenerator project is a Python application that automates the creation of documentation for a given GitHub repository. The project consists of several components, including environment setup, repository cloning, documentation planning, and documentation creation.

## Introduction
The DocumentationGenerator project is a Python application that automates the creation of documentation for a given GitHub repository. The project consists of several components, including environment setup, repository cloning, documentation planning, and documentation creation.

## Environment Setup
The environment setup workflow sets up the necessary environment variables and configuration for the script. This includes installing required dependencies and configuring the project settings.

```plain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Cloning
The repository cloning workflow clones the given GitHub repository to a local directory. This is done using the git clone command.

```plain
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

## Documentation Planning
The documentation planning workflow plans the documentation by analyzing the codebase and creating a plan for the documentation. This includes identifying the components and relationships between them.

```markdown
# Documentation plan
## Components
* Environment setup
* Repository cloning
* Documentation planning
* Documentation creation
## Relationships
* Environment setup -> Repository cloning
* Repository cloning -> Documentation planning
* Documentation planning -> Documentation creation
```

## Documentation Creation
The documentation creation workflow creates the documentation based on the plan, including drafting the documentation and reviewing it.

```markdown
# Documentation creation
## Drafting
* Write introduction
* Write environment setup section
* Write repository cloning section
* Write documentation planning section
* Write documentation creation section
## Reviewing
* Review introduction
* Review environment setup section
* Review repository cloning section
* Review documentation planning section
* Review documentation creation section
```

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
3. Configure the project settings: cp .env.example .env
